    <h1>Netbook Journey - Part 1</h1>
</header>

<p>Recently friend of mine gave me a netbook, it has several issues but gift is a gift and I accepted it.
     It was piano black, little and sturdy. After some observing and dreaming I began to investigate.</p>
<p>There was no visible cracks on screen or case. So I charged a bit and pushed the start button. 
    And "bang!" it doesn't work (I generally don't have luck with this kind of situations.). 
    With further investigation I found out that mother board is all rusty and charging port sparking. 
    When there is nothing to lose, men destined to become beast. And I did exactly that, cleaned it harshly, yeah. 
    For my surprise it worked! Now I have almost 15 years old netbook with gigabyte of DDRII memory.</p>
<p>It worked but hard drive was screaming and I did most humane thing, ended his suffering. 
    Luckily I have spare hard drive lying around. I replaced hard drive and almost immediately installed linux on it. 
    My choice of distro was Debian. There is no particular reason for it but
     I like their 'stability over bleeding edge' philosophy though one situation made me doubt in my opinion. </p>
<p>Some packages has problems and they're solved but latest debian update doesn't contain latest and problemless version 
    I did it manually but it cost me about 3 minutes of my time. Luckily I don't have a better thing to do. </p>
