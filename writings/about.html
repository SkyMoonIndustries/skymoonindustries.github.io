    <h1>About</h1>
</header>
<p>I am Gökay Uysal. Computer Engineering student. I mostly work on hardware but also like to use and tweak linux systems.</p>
<p>To me Linux is gateway to most efficient system theory. Not just OS, philosophy of Linux is also made me who I am today.
To me everything about Linux is chasing efficiency, repurposing everything and shape everything to your needs/likings. 
Because of these kinda things I fell in love with Linux in 2016. Since then I'm trying to design world around me according to this philosophy.</p>
<p>I think tinkering with microcontrollers too needs this kind of philosophy.
Making computer tasks with microcontrollers beautifully fits in with this philosophy. 
That's why nowadays I'm working of Edge Computing with ESP32 (my favorite microcontroller). </p>
<p>Apart from microcontrollers, I also servers and enterprise-level hardwares. 
    I have a small server of my own, though it’s not that powerful I still like to tinker with it.</p>

<p>I also have a small laboratory/workshop of my own. I spend most of my time here. 
    Tinkering and repairing things or simply thinking about things.</p>
<img src="/images/lab.jpg" alt="Laboratory/Workshop" class="responsive-img" title="My Small Laboratory/Workshop">
<p>My goal in life is to live without worry, working on my ideas and inventing the things I want to see in the world. 
    Nowadays my life is slowly shifting towards this goal, and despite the sleepless nights and moments of frustration,
     I am mostly happy with this change.
